## Project Overview

This Compiler Design Lab project aims to develop a simple compiler for a custom programming language. The compiler consists of several components, including:

- Lexical Analysis (Scanner)
- Syntax Analysis (Parser)
- Semantic Analysis
- Intermediate Code Generation
- Code Optimization
- Code Generation
- Symbol Table Management
- Error Handling

Throughout this lab, you will learn how to implement these components and how to create a working compiler.
